Article under review.

This repository contains 5 notebooks (under Visuals) that contain the entire workflow of our analysis.

__Important message!__<br>
Currently, not all the datasets used in this analysis are openly available yet. All of them will be openly available in the coming months.
We make use of two observational burned area datasets, FireCCI5.1 (open) and GFED5 (under review, open after publication).
We also use simulations by seven models of the ISIMIP framework. These are all open. 
However, from these seven models, two are currently available from the ISIMIP data repository. The other five will become available during the coming weeks/months.
